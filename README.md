# 2-Pistons-2-Furious
Ever since I drove the go-karts at Fort Fun, I was obsessed with a machine made of metal, 4 wheels, and a steering wheel. I have always dreamed of owning my own car, being able to drive myself to places, but I am not old enough yet. So for my personal project, I choose to build my own vehicle, a go-kart. My goal is to design and build a go-kart frame and research parts - wheels, gears, chains, etc. - that I will need for the go-kart to run. Throughout the project, I want to learn how to design a safe and sturdy go-kart frame, weld the frame, and work with engines. 

**Planning**
My plan for this project is to do some research on the fundamental basics of a go-kart: what type of engines are used, how big the wheels should be, gear ratios, etc. After doing some research, I noticed that the shape of a go-kart frame is all the same.

It is generally on a flat plane and really compact. One concern that I had with this design is its safety. Although you can add bumpers to it, there are no doors/walls around the driver, meaning that your arms and body would be exposed. Instead, I decided to design my own frame, making it more like a car roll cage so that the driver will be protected all around.

**Applying Skills**
For designing the go-kart, I first made some sketches in my notebook. My goal was to get a rough idea to build off of.
