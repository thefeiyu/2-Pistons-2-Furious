#IB Personal Project - 2 Pistons 2 Furious

For my personal project, I designed and built a go-kart. I started with making rough sketches in a notebook to get a general design for the go-kart, and then modeled it to scale using Onshape, a CAD software. The frame design was shaped like a roll cage, incorperating triangles into the design to insure minimum flex in the frame. With the design complete, I found a welding shop and mentor who taught me how to build the go-frame. I learned to use many different saws, how to weld, use angle grinders, and how to build with precision. I also had to research and find compatable parts for the go-kart: wheels, shaft, gears, etc.
